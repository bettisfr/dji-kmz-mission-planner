# DJI KMZ Mission Planner

A browser-based editor for waypoint missions, built with Python, Flask and MapLibre GL JS. Place waypoints on a satellite map, configure their actions, and export the mission as a KMZ archive using DJI WPML elements.

This project is an experimental local tool. Compatibility with specific DJI aircraft, payloads and mission applications has not been established.

## Features

- Add waypoints by clicking the map and move them by dragging their markers.
- Insert a waypoint between two existing points using the **+** marker.
- Edit mission height, speed and payload position index.
- Add, remove, edit and drag to reorder waypoint actions.
- Undo and redo edits with buttons or keyboard shortcuts.
- Load supported KMZ files and download the edited mission.

Supported actions: `takePhoto`, `focus`, `zoom`, `gimbalRotate`, `rotateYaw` and `hover`.

## Getting started

You need Python 3 with `pip` and virtual environment support, a modern browser, and a MapTiler web API key. Internet access is required for map tiles and the frontend libraries loaded from CDNs.

Run these commands from a terminal on Linux or macOS:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bettisfr/dji-kmz-mission-planner.git
cd dji-kmz-mission-planner
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install Flask geopy lxml
mkdir -p out
export MAPTILER_WEB_API_KEY="your-maptiler-web-api-key"
python server.py
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:5000> in your browser. Run the server from the repository root: file paths are relative to the working directory.

On Windows PowerShell, activate the environment with `.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`, create the output directory with `New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force out`, and set the key with `$env:MAPTILER_WEB_API_KEY = "your-maptiler-web-api-key"`.

The MapTiler key is sent to the browser for map requests. Use a key intended for web use and configure its allowed origins in your MapTiler account. The app reads the environment variable directly; it does not automatically load a `.env` file.

## Usage

1. The app starts with a sample mission near Assisi, Italy.
2. Click the map to append waypoints, drag markers to move them, or click a **+** marker to insert a point along the route.
3. Edit global parameters in the sidebar. Current height and speed inputs accept whole numbers; keep speed greater than zero. Height is in metres and speed is in metres per second.
4. Click **add** beside a waypoint's actions to choose an action and enter its parameters. Drag action blocks to change their execution order. Edited values are submitted when the input loses focus.
5. Use **Undo** / **Redo**, `Ctrl+Z` / `Ctrl+Shift+Z` or `Ctrl+Y` (`Cmd` on macOS). Shortcuts leave native text editing behavior in place while an input has focus.
6. Click **Save** to download `mission.kmz`, or **Load** to replace the current mission with a supported archive.

Save your work before restarting the server: mission data and undo history live in memory, and a restart restores the sample mission.

## KMZ support and current limitations

The importer and exporter implement a limited subset of WPML with namespace `http://www.dji.com/wpmz/1.0.3`.

- Archives currently contain `waylines.wpml` and `template.kml` at the archive root. The importer expects `waylines.wpml` there; archives containing it under `wpmz/` are not supported.
- The exported `template.kml` is a minimal document. Full compatibility with DJI mission editors is not guaranteed.
- Export uses fixed aircraft and payload identifiers (`droneEnumValue=60`, `payloadEnumValue=42`) and fixed mission behavior, including return home on completion. These settings are defined in `parser_xml.py`.
- All waypoints share one height and speed. Import reads takeoff security height and transitional speed into those global values; individual waypoint settings and other unsupported data are not preserved when exporting again.
- Only the actions and parameters listed in `mission.py` are supported. Unknown actions or missing XML fields can cause import errors.
- Use filenames with a single extension, such as `survey.kmz`; additional dots currently break the import filename handling.
- Mission state, undo history and output files are shared by all browser sessions connected to the same server.
- The app uses Flask's development server with debug mode enabled and has no authentication. Run it locally and load trusted files.

Review exported mission settings in a compatible mission application before using them with an aircraft.

## Project structure

```text
server.py               Flask routes, shared mission state, undo/redo
mission.py              Mission, waypoint and action models
parser_xml.py           XML serialization and KMZ import/export
templates/index.html    Main application page
templates/map_config.js Browser map configuration
static/script.js        Map interactions, sidebar and API requests
static/styles.css       Application styles
out/                    Generated archives, XML and uploaded files
```

The frontend uses MapLibre GL JS, MapTiler satellite imagery, jQuery and jQuery UI. No frontend build step is required.

Issues and pull requests are welcome. For import or compatibility problems, include the error message, the expected behavior and a minimal mission example with sensitive coordinates removed.
